**GitHub repository creation guide**

When creating a GitHub repository you need to follow a few organizational
standardization rules :
- When naming your repository use lowercase. This makes it easier for command
  line use.
- Use a dash ( - ) and not an underscore ( _ ) to separate words in the
  repository name.
- Make the repository public.
- Add a description.
- Create a LICENSE.md file.
- Protect your branches.

## How to Create a LICENSE.md File

1. Create a new file and name it `LICENSE.md`.

![Create
LICENSE.md](https://github.com/ai-cfia/devops/assets/9827730/540c2ee8-fc49-4c76-88c7-115ac8ffcae2)

2. Click on "Choose a license template."
3. Choose "MIT License," and all the needed information will be filled in for
   you.

![Choose MIT
License](https://github.com/ai-cfia/devops/assets/9827730/f7d4576f-1a3e-4a95-98e8-7c67dbd32705)

4. Click on "Review and submit" to create your file.

## Why you need to protect your branches

Protecting branches in GitHub is essential for maintaining code integrity,
ensuring a consistent commit history, and safeguarding against disruptive
changes. By mandating code reviews, preventing force pushes, and requiring
scrutiny of contributions, branch protection provides a foundational layer of
security and quality control in collaborative projects.

## How to Protect Your Branch

1. Go to your repository's main page.
2. Click on the "Settings" option on the top right.

4. Make sure to check "Require a pull request before merging," and also ensure
   that "Require approvals" is checked. You can leave the default option for the
   number of required approvals.
