**GitHub repository creation guide**

When creating a GitHub repository you need to follow a few organizational standardization rules :
- When naming your repository use lowercase. This makes it easier for command line use.
- Use a dash ( - ) and not an underscore ( _ ) to separate words in the repository name.
- Make the repository public.
- Add a description.
- Create a LICENCE.md file.
- Protect your branches.

**How to create a LICENSE.md file**

**Why you need to protect your branches**

Protecting branches in GitHub is essential for maintaining code integrity, ensuring a consistent commit history, and safeguarding against disruptive changes. By mandating code reviews, preventing force pushes, and requiring scrutiny of contributions, branch protection provides a foundational layer of security and quality control in collaborative projects.

**How to protect your branch**

1. Head on over to your repository's main page.
2. Click on the settings options on the top right.
